Global Monitor Test System
--------------------------

(A) 	Introduction
	------------

In order to make it possible to test the Global Monitor System independently
of the existence of a global run, I have developed a test system that mimics
the operations in the real system. At the heart of the test system is the
newly developed job control script GMjob.py, which resides in the scripts
directory of the global_mon package. GMjob.py script is intended to replace 
the six shell scripts that are currently used to launch the six GM jobs, three
for Trigger Examine and three for Physics Examine. The GMjob.py script is
configured using a Job Description File, an example of which is shown below.

The test system, using GMjob.py and GMhisto.jdf, runs a program called gmtuple
that creates an updating root-tuple called tuple.root in the directory

	$GM_RELEASE_DIR

The creation of tuple.root is akin to the creation of d0_analyze.root. GMjob.py
then runs a histogrammer called GMhisto.C that creates updating histograms in 
the file histo.root in the development area

	$GM_RELEASE_DIR


Finally, an executable version of gmbrowser is run to view the histograms. 

(B) 	Brief Description of New Elements of global_mon
 	-----------------------------------------------

The global_mon package is in the development area $GM_RELEASE_DIR/global_mon.
The package contains:

	1. gmbrowser	An executable version of GM.cpp

	2. gmtuple	A program to create a simple updating root-tuple
			in $GM_RELEASE_DIR/tuple called tuple.root

	3. GMhisto.C	A histogramming macro that creates 4 simple updating
			histograms from tuple.root, in the file histo.root

	4. GMhisto.jdf	An example of a Job Description File that controls the
			script GMjob.py that launches the specified GM jobs

				a. The root-tuple maker
				b. The histogrammer
				c. The browser

	5. GMhisto.cfg	An example of a GM browser configuration file

The files GMhisto.* are in global_mon/test.
