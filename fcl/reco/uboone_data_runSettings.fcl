# Notes on August 25, 2015
# According to Leon the three parameters below are:
# 1) E field for TPC in kV/cm
# 2) Wire bias U to V in kV/cm
# 3) Wire bias V to W in kV/cm
#
# Note that run 1591 forward, bias is -158 and +23
# Plane space is 0.3cm
# These settings for the change in wire bias 8/13/15
