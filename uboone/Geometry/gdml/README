v0,v1,v2 contains 30 PMT geometry

microboone.gdml (microboone_nowires.gdml): contains old gdml (MCC5). Same as microboonev0*gdml
microboonev0.gdml (microboonev0_nowires.gdml): contains old gdml (MCC5)
microboonev1.gdml (microboonev2_nowires.gdml): contains corrected tpc, detenclosure, platform volumes and mass of steel in middle of each rack
microboonev2.gdml (microboonev3_nowires.gdml): contains roof, supporting walls, G10 bars on TPC

v3,v4,v5,v6 contain 32 PMT geometry
microboonev3.gdml (microboonev3_nowires.gdml): geometry used to generate 32 PMT photon library (contains changes listed in v1 above)
microboonev4.gdml (microboonev4_nowires.gdml): compatible with v2 above (+32 pmt geometry), contains detailed information about platform above cryostat
microboonev5.gdml (microboonev5_nowires.gdml): Contains the correct number of racks.  Was previously 10, now 15. 
microboonev6.gdml (microboonev6_nowires.gdml): Contains the 2 wires which were previously missing 

v7 has the correct shape of liquid argon and cold argon gas
microboonev7.gdml (microboonev7_nowires.gdml): Has the correct shape of liquid argon and cold gas inside tank; tank thickness was also corrected. Previous versions had extra LAr outside the vessel endcap and above the active region in the tank, no ullage.

v8 replaces the air above ground with vacuum 

v9 rotates the roof of LARTF by 39 degrees -- it is no longer aligned with Cryostat

v10 moves the PMTs out of the wires planes. 

v10_opticalSim Removes the platform for the sake of optical sim generation-- it is currently uncertain why platform volume caused these jobs to fail. 

vX
microboonevX.gdml (microboonevX_nowires.gdml): Working gdml.  This file (may) contain working changes which are not tagged with a version. Don't use this gdml.
