# Prepared July-2013 by William Seligman <seligman@nevis.columbia.edu>

# This is an example job for running the MicroBooNE PMT ADC and FEM simulation.
# The input file can come from any standard detector-simulation job
# that includes a LArG4 (largeant) step. The output will include digitized,
# discriminated, and triggered PMT ADC counts; see the OpticalDetectorData
# package for the data products added to the event.
