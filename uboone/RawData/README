There is a ubdaq branch now to uboonecode. It is intended to be the one in which to work if you
are going to swizzle *.ubdaq files. This is in contrast to the develop branch, as 
you would ordinarily be on for LArSoft.

This branch now uses includes and .so's that live in UBOONEDAQ_DATATYPES.

UBOONEDAQ_DATATYPES itself is made from the uboonedaq repository. A new e5 version (gcc 2.8.2 and
boost 1.55.0) of UBOONEDAQ_DATATYPES was made and installed for the sake of this exercise.
(It lives on the e5 branch of uboonedaq, but as a LArSoft coder, you don't need to know that.) One 
must setup against UBOONEDAQ_DATATYPES in order to build, since LArSoft uses these more modern
versions of gcc and boost.

So, in addition to your usual LArSoft setup, please do the following 

setup uboonedaq_datatypes v4_00_01 -qe5:prof
setup boost v1_55_0 -qe5:prof

Then, the usual cd build; mrbsetenv; mrb i;
